# calva-lib

Some of the functionality of the [Calva] family of Visual Studio Code extensions is provided by this library. It is built as an npm module, [@cospaia/calva-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cospaia/calva-lib), but not meant for public consumption.

See the [How to Contribute](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva/wiki/How-to-Contribute) wiki page for Calva for instruction on how to hack on this.

Also feel invited to join the [`#calva-dev` channel](https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/calva-dev/) channel in the Clojurians Slack.
